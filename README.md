# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The README explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
We should 
1)  submit a tidy data set.
2) The Github repo contains the required scripts.
   GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates to indicate all the variables and summaries        calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
creates a  tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
